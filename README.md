# SwiftTranscriptionSampleApp
The sample app from WWDC25 session 277: [Bring advanced speech-to-text to your app with SpeechAnalyzer](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277/). The original code can be found and downloaded from [Apple's documentation website](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/bringing-advanced-speech-to-text-capabilities-to-your-app).

The goal of this repo is to get the AVFoundation AudioEngine code working with Swift 6 concurrency requirements. The original sample app uses Swift 5.
